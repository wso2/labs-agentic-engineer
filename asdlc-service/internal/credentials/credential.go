// Package credentials is the single seam for GitHub authentication in
// git-service. Every code path that calls GitHub or runs `git` against a
// remote routes through Resolver.Resolve(ocOrgID) to obtain a Credential,
// then asks the credential for a token, identity, repo-owner, or webhook
// strategy as needed.
//
// The Phase 0 implementation (PlatformPATResolver) returns a single platform
// PAT for every org. Phase 2 introduces App-installation and per-org
// user-PAT kinds; call sites do not change because they consume the
// polymorphic Credential surface.
//
// Three architectural rules these types enforce:
//
//   1. No call site type-switches on Credential.
//   2. No call site reads identity, repo-owner, or token from any other
//      source — not env, not the GitRepository row.
//   3. Every external GitHub operation passes ocOrgID explicitly. Resolvers
//      refuse an empty ocOrgID.
