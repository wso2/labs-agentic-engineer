// Golden tests for the `exposesAPI` rubric from prompt.ts. These are the
// canonical examples the architect agent is expected to handle the same
// way. When the rubric changes, update these tests AND the prompt — they
// must move together. Five cases cover one path each:
//   1. public hello-world (no triggers)
//   2. login surface (auth-verbs)
//   3. JWT-protected API (identity-tokens)
//   4. billing service (payment-regulated)
//   5. customer-data store (user-scoped-data) — also confirms 'private'
//      from access-intent stacks correctly when multiple families hit.
